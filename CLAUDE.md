# Quantum Chess — project guide (for Claude)

A hotseat (2 local humans, no timer) chess variant: standard chess plus a
**superposition / collapse** layer. Pieces can *split* into ghosts with
probabilities; contact triggers a random **collapse** that reveals where a piece
really was.

**Read `PLAN.md` first** — it is the living spec (full ruleset, dials, milestones).
`options.md` is the user's original design-dial brainstorm.

## Stack
- Python 3.13, **`python-chess`** (movement oracle only), **`pygame-ce`** (UI), `pytest`.
- Pieces are drawn from a **selectable piece set** (added 2026-07-12, see
  `ui/pieces.py` below): real vector art (`cburnett`/`merida`, SVGs rasterized
  via pygame-ce's native `load_sized_svg` — no external dep), a runtime-generated
  `neon` silhouette set, or the original `unicode` glyphs. Alpha still tracks
  probability. The whole UI is **supersampled** (`theme.SCALE`, drawn at 2x and
  smooth-scaled to the window via `ui/present.py`) so it's crisp, not pixelated.
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Locked v1 design decisions (don't silently change these)
- **Win = capture the king.** No check / checkmate / stalemate. The king is an
  ordinary, capturable, splittable piece. (The **check-probability overlay**
  added 2026-07-11 — `quantumchess/check.py`, see below — is *purely advisory*
  and does **not** reintroduce a check rule: it never restricts a move, it only
  displays how likely a king is to be capturable next turn.)
- **A piece superposes only with its own ghosts — no cross-piece entanglement, ever.**
- **A turn = one action on one ghost:** move it, or *split* it into two (`p → p/2, p/2`).
  (The optional **`mass_movement`** dial, added 2026-07-11, relaxes this: with it
  on, a *superposed* piece may instead move **all** of its ghosts in one planned
  turn — see `collapse.resolve_mass_move` below. Off by default; it's the
  independent-target "all-ghosts move" variant of a previously-deferred dial.)
- **Collapse modes (match dial)** — behaviour on a *negative* measurement ("not here"):
  - *Partial*: only the contacted ghost vanishes; the rest renormalize.
  - *Full*: resolve the whole piece to one location; drop the others.
  (A *positive* measurement always collapses the piece to solid, both modes.)
- **Path collapse:** a mover measures every ghost it passes. Real ⇒ movement stops
  there (capture if enemy); not-there ⇒ it continues. One move can collapse a chain
  and stop short of its target.
- **No split cap** — probabilities may shrink to 1/2ⁿ; collapses thin them out.
- **Castling** (added 2026-07-11, see `rules.py`/`collapse.py` below): only for a
  king/rook that has *never* moved or split (tracked via `Piece.has_moved`),
  which means it's guaranteed solid on its home square. No check concept
  exists in this variant, so there's no "can't castle through/into check"
  restriction — only occupancy matters. A king may also *split* one branch
  toward the castle square (added 2026-07-11, per user request) — the rook is
  never superposed by this: it always makes one plain, deterministic
  relocation alongside whichever branch reaches the castle square, exactly
  mirroring a full-move castle's "rook follows only if the walk completes."
- Deferred dials (documented, not yet built): symmetric all-ghosts move,
  equal-`1/n` probabilities, exotic promotion/en-passant interactions. (The
  **independent** all-ghosts *move* variant shipped 2026-07-11 as the
  `mass_movement` dial — see `resolve_mass_move`. The **all-ghosts split**
  variant shipped 2026-07-13 as the `mass_split` dial layered on top of it —
  each ghost in a mass turn may move *or* split; see `resolve_mass_split`.)

## Architecture
- **Engine is headless** — `quantumchess/` must not import `pygame`. UI is a thin
  layer so the quantum logic stays unit-testable (and a web frontend stays possible).
- `model.py` — `Piece`, `Ghost`, `QuantumBoard` (probabilities are exact `Fraction`s).
  `to_classical_board()` projects a *solid* position onto a python-chess board and is
  used both for ASCII rendering and as the movement oracle. `Piece.has_moved`
  (added 2026-07-11 for castling, see `rules.py` below) is set the instant a
  piece is moved *or* split, ever — even if it later re-merges back onto its
  home square, it stays permanently disqualified from castling.
- `rules.py` — `Move`/`MoveKind`/`Split`, `generate_moves` (pseudo-legal via
  `Board.attacks` over solids, so it extends to quantum blockers), `apply_move`,
  `apply_split`, `legal_split_targets`, `split_destination_kind`, `remove_piece`.
  Occupancy invariant: **≤1 ghost per square** (same-piece ghosts merge; a
  different piece's ghost is a `CONTACT` = needs collapse). `CONTACT` moves are
  generated only on request (`include_contact=True`) and `apply_move` raises
  `NotImplementedError` on them — resolution lives in `collapse.py`.
  `legal_split_targets` includes squares that would capture/contact an enemy
  (splitting into an enemy-occupied square is legal — see `resolve_split`
  below); `apply_split` itself stays the measurement-free fast path and raises
  if either destination needs a collapse.
  **Mass movement** (added 2026-07-11): `MassMove(piece_id, assignments)` where
  `assignments` is one `(from_square, to_square)` per current ghost of the piece
  (`to == from` means "stay"). `mass_assignment_move(qb, pid, from, to)` returns
  the classified `Move` for one leg (a "stay" is a measurement-free `RELOCATE`
  on its own square; otherwise it's whichever `ghost_destinations` move lands on
  `to`). A promoting pawn leg carries its chosen promotion piece via
  `MassMove.promotions` (`(from_square, ptype)` pairs), which
  `mass_assignment_move`'s `promotion` arg selects among the per-piece promotion
  candidates — the player picks it per leg in the UI (same promotion picker as a
  single move), defaulting to a queen only if unspecified. Resolution lives in
  `collapse.resolve_mass_move`.
  **Mass split** (added 2026-07-13): `MassSplit(piece_id, legs, promotions)` is
  the strict generalization of `MassMove` for the `mass_split` dial — `legs` is
  one `(from_square, destinations)` per current ghost where `destinations` is a
  tuple of **one** square (that ghost relocates, `to == from` = stay, exactly a
  `MassMove` leg) or **two distinct** squares (that ghost *splits* into two
  `p/2` halves). `promotions` here is keyed by both squares
  (`(from_square, to_square, ptype)` triples) since a single ghost can split
  into two promoting destinations that each need their own pick. Each leg still
  goes through `mass_assignment_move` for classification. Resolution lives in
  `collapse.resolve_mass_split`, which reuses the same single-measurement core
  as a mass move (a split just contributes extra half-probability legs).
  **Castling** (added 2026-07-11, user asked "should I be able to castle here?"
  after a playtest reached a position where it should be legal): `Move` gained
  `castle_rook: Optional[tuple[rook_piece_id, rook_from, rook_to]]`, set only on
  the king's own move. `_castle_moves` offers it when the king and that side's
  rook both have `has_moved == False` (which — since nothing ever touched them —
  guarantees both are still solid on their home squares, no separate "is it
  solid" check needed). The king's 2-square hop is classified with the exact
  same `_classify`/`_path_has_foreign_ghost` helpers used for any other slide,
  so it comes out as `RELOCATE` (clear path), `CAPTURE_SOLID` (a solid enemy
  sitting on the final square — castling-into-a-capture is allowed, unlike real
  chess, to stay consistent with "a king slide is a king slide"), or `CONTACT`
  (a ghost, friendly or foreign, anywhere on the path) — resolution of the
  first two happens right here in `apply_move`; `CONTACT` defers to
  `collapse.resolve_move` like any other sliding contact. The one square that
  belongs to the rook alone (b-file, queenside) is never on the king's path, so
  it isn't resolved by any walk — it's required to be completely empty (no
  ghost at all) as a precondition for offering queenside castling, a
  deliberate simplification (no "rook-side collapse" mechanic was designed).
  `apply_move`/`collapse.resolve_move` both relocate the rook **only if the
  king's move/walk actually reaches the full castle destination** — a king that
  stops short (captures a path ghost, or gets blocked short by a confirmed
  friendly one) leaves the rook untouched, mirroring "path collapse can stop a
  move short of its target."
  **Split-based castling** (added 2026-07-11, user asked for it explicitly
  after a UI crash — splitting a king toward the castle square used to be
  excluded from `legal_split_targets`/`split_destination_kind` via
  `include_castle=False`, but the UI's split-mode highlight dict still offered
  the square by mistake, so picking it raised `ValueError` in
  `resolve_split`). Rather than re-excluding it, castling was extended to
  splits: both functions now call `ghost_destinations` with the default
  `include_castle=True`, so a castle destination is a normal split target
  reported as whatever `MoveKind` it actually is (`RELOCATE`/`CAPTURE_SOLID`/
  `CONTACT`). A new `split_destination_castle_rook(qb, square, to_square) ->
  Optional[tuple[rook_id, rook_from, rook_to]]` (same `ghost_destinations`
  lookup, just returning `.castle_rook` instead of `.kind`) is how
  `apply_split`/`collapse.resolve_split` find out a branch is a castling one.
  **The rook itself is never superposed/split** — it always makes one plain,
  deterministic relocation: for a clear-path (`RELOCATE`) branch there's
  nothing to measure, so `apply_split` moves it unconditionally the instant
  the branch is placed; for a `CAPTURE_SOLID`/`CONTACT` branch (enemy on the
  destination or path), `collapse.resolve_split`/`_resolve_split_branch` move
  it only once *that specific branch* is confirmed to have actually reached
  the castle square — capture branches always complete once confirmed present
  (no foreign ghosts on the path by construction), contact branches only if
  `_walk_contact`'s `stop_square` equals the full destination — the exact same
  "rook follows only if the king's own walk completes" rule `resolve_move`
  already used, just applied per-branch instead of per-move. Both `apply_split`
  and `resolve_split` classify the destinations (and look up `castle_rook`)
  **before** marking the piece's `has_moved = True` — marking it first (the
  original order) made the king look already-moved to that same classification
  call, which silently turned every castle branch into "not a castle" (a
  second real bug caught while building this, before it shipped). UI:
  `app.py::_handle_split_click` snapshots the rook's pre-split `Token`,
  executes the split, then checks (same pattern as `_execute_move`) whether
  the rook actually landed on `rook_to` before adding it to the slide
  animation and logging a `castle_verb` line alongside the split's own log
  line. 124 tests passing (`tests/test_castling.py` covers the clear-path,
  solid-capture, and both collapse-branch cases; `_legal_by_square` no longer
  needs a split-mode-only `include_castle` override).
- `textview.py` — headless ASCII board (`*B*` = ghost) + exact-fraction legend.
- `config.py` — `GameConfig` (dials), `CollapseMode`. Split out from `game.py` so
  `collapse.py` can import it without a circular dependency; re-exported from
  `game.py` for convenience. Carries `mass_movement: bool = False` (added
  2026-07-11) — the optional dial enabling whole-superposition moves; enforced
  at the UI layer (`App.can_mass`) like `splitting_enabled`, since the engine's
  `resolve_mass_move` is dial-agnostic. Carries `mass_split: bool = False`
  (added 2026-07-13) — the optional dial (only meaningful with `mass_movement`
  on) letting each ghost in a mass turn *split* as well as move; likewise
  enforced at the UI layer (`App.can_mass_split`), with `resolve_mass_split`
  dial-agnostic. Also carries the cosmetic (non-logic) match-setup
  fields: `theme` ("origin"/"cyberpunk"), `white_name`/`black_name`,
  `white_color`/`black_color` (RGB tuples, only meaningful for cyberpunk), plus
  `team_name(color)`/`team_color(color)` helpers keyed off the python-chess
  colour bool. Kept here (not in `ui/`) so `persistence.py` can round-trip them
  without importing pygame, and so the engine-level `GameConfig` stays the
  single source of truth for a match's identity. Added 2026-07-11 alongside the
  cyberpunk theme, per the user's ask to let players pick a team name + colour.
- `collapse.py` — `resolve_move`: the collapse engine. **Measurement only happens
  on collision** — `RELOCATE`/`MERGE` (empty square, or the mover's own ghost)
  skip straight to a plain `apply_move`, no dice involved, **except a pawn
  landing on the promotion rank while it's still just a ghost** (added
  2026-07-11, per the user: "when a pawn reaches a homerun and if he is just a
  ghost, collide his function immediately. If present, he will be promoted. If
  absent, his problem"). `_resolve_promotion_relocate` relocates the ghost
  first (via `apply_move` with `promotion` stripped, so the deterministic part
  still goes through the normal no-dice path), then measures that one ghost
  against its own probability exactly like a mover's self-check on a
  `CAPTURE_SOLID`/`CONTACT` move: really there ⇒ `_collapse_positive` (confirm
  solid, drop every sibling) then apply the promotion; not there ⇒
  `_collapse_negative` (collapse mode applies to whatever siblings remain), no
  promotion — the piece just stays a pawn wherever it ends up. A fully solid
  pawn (`prob == 1`, no siblings) has nothing left to measure and promotes
  exactly as before, no dice drawn. Logged as a `CollapseEvent` with role
  `"promotion"`, wired into the UI the same way a `"mover"`/`"split"`
  self-measurement is (`ui/animation.py`'s `_solidify` matches it by piece, and
  `ui/skins/hud.py`'s glitch overlay treats a negative promotion roll as a
  whole-board glitch, not a minor aside — it's the climactic moment of the
  turn same as a fizzled mover). Covered by
  `tests/test_m3_collapse.py::test_ghost_pawn_promotion_*` /
  `test_solid_pawn_promotion_relocate_is_still_unmeasured`. 128 tests passing.
  Any move that touches
  another piece (`CAPTURE_SOLID` or `CONTACT`) measures the mover first (positive
  ⇒ solid, drop siblings; negative ⇒ fizzle + apply collapse mode) — **this
  applies even when capturing a certain/solid piece**: a superposed mover isn't
  guaranteed to land the capture just because the target is certain (was a real
  bug, fixed 2026-07-10 after the user asked "is movement measured only in case
  of collision?"). For `CONTACT`, after the mover is confirmed, walk the path
  square-by-square measuring every foreign ghost in turn (enemy real ⇒ capture &
  stop there; friendly real ⇒ confirm it solid & stop one square before it;
  not-there ⇒ apply collapse mode, keep walking) — one move can resolve several
  pieces' superpositions in a row. Returns a `MoveResolution` (fizzled?,
  final_square, captured_piece_ids) plus an ordered `CollapseEvent` log for the
  UI animation. Ends the game via king capture same as `apply_move`.
  Each `CollapseEvent` carries not just the measurement (role/piece/square/
  prob_before/present) but its *visual consequence* — `removed` (the
  `(square, prob)` of every ghost that measurement wiped: siblings on a positive
  collapse, the measured ghost + FULL-mode siblings on a negative one, a captured
  piece's other ghosts) and `captured_square` (where an enemy was taken, for a
  shatter effect). Populated by having `_collapse_positive`/`_collapse_negative`
  *return* what they drop; the dataclass is no longer frozen so the resolver can
  fill these in after the mutating helper reports back. This is what lets the UI
  animate a collapse without re-deriving the engine math. Kept fully headless.
  `resolve_split`: splitting into an enemy-occupied square used to be silently
  illegal (`legal_split_targets` excluded `CAPTURE_SOLID`/`CONTACT` outright,
  so the UI just deselected the click) — fixed 2026-07-11 after the user asked
  for one split branch to be able to capture. Both branches settle in the same
  instant the split is made: measurement-free branches (empty/same-piece
  merge) are placed unconditionally first, then each enemy-contacting branch
  is measured exactly like a move's mover (a p/2 branch capturing even a
  certain piece isn't guaranteed) — positive confirms it solid there and wipes
  every other ghost of that piece (siblings included, via `_collapse_positive`,
  reused from `resolve_move`); negative removes just that branch and
  renormalizes the rest via `_collapse_negative`. A `CONTACT`-kind branch
  additionally walks the path via the same `_walk_contact` helper `resolve_move`
  uses (extracted during this fix), so a sliding split-branch can still capture
  or stop short partway there. If splitting into *two* enemy-occupied squares
  at once, the first branch resolved that confirms real skips measuring the
  second entirely (the piece is settled; that square is never touched).
  `resolve_move`'s `CAPTURE_SOLID`/`CONTACT` branches also carry the castling
  rook-follow logic (see `rules.py` above) — for `CONTACT` specifically, the
  rook only relocates if `_walk_contact`'s `stop_square` equals the king's
  full destination, and needs no measurement of its own since `rook_to` is
  always one of the squares the king's own walk already resolved.
  `resolve_mass_move` (added 2026-07-11, for the `mass_movement` dial — user:
  "move all ghosts in [a piece's] superposition in one move ... resolve any
  potential conflicts without the need to collapse all ghosts"): each leg of a
  `MassMove` is classified against the pre-move board (via
  `rules.mass_assignment_move`) as *safe* (`RELOCATE`/`MERGE`) or a *conflict*
  (`CONTACT`/`CAPTURE_SOLID`, or a still-superposed pawn promoting — promotions
  need a measurement, so they count as conflicts). **No conflicts ⇒ every ghost
  just relocates** (probabilities merge by destination, no dice, ep cleared —
  the same "quiet move is instant" rule as elsewhere). **≥1 conflict ⇒ one
  categorical roll** (`_roll_entry`, weighted by each ghost's `prob`, which sum
  to 1 — the generalization of a single mover's Bernoulli `_flip`) picks where
  the piece *really* is. If the winning leg is **safe**, the conflicting ghosts
  vanish and — **obeying the match's collapse-mode dial** — PARTIAL keeps the
  safe ghosts renormalized (piece stays superposed) while FULL collapses the
  whole piece onto the rolled square (`_collapse_positive`); enemies on the
  *dropped* legs are never measured (the piece dodged). If the winning leg is a
  **conflict**, the piece goes solid on that slide (`_collapse_positive` drops
  every other ghost) and the slide resolves exactly like a `resolve_move`
  `CONTACT`/`CAPTURE_SOLID` — reusing `_walk_contact` to measure the enemy on
  its path ("measure the enemy too"), so it can capture or stop short. Returns a
  `MassMoveResolution` (events for the UI animation, `captured_piece_ids`, plus
  `final_square`/`chosen_from` — the solid landing and winning ghost's source
  when the piece collapsed, so `App._confirm_plan` can slide that ghost to its
  real square while the losers fade). Provably reduces to today's single move
  (move one ghost, hold the rest) in both modes: `P(solid at s) = p_s` either
  way. Headless; covered by `tests/test_mass_move.py`.
  `resolve_mass_split` (added 2026-07-13, for the `mass_split` dial — user:
  "if mass move is on ... a toggle to turn on/off mass split too — when on, I
  can split multiple ghosts, each ghost has an option to move or split") is the
  generalization: a ghost with a single-destination leg relocates exactly like
  a mass-move leg, a two-destination leg splits that ghost's probability in half
  across the two. The `resolve_mass_move` internals were refactored into
  `_classify_mass_entry` (one leg → a classified `_MassEntry`) + a shared
  `_resolve_mass_entries` core (roll among the entries, whose probs sum to 1;
  the exact same no-conflict / safe-dodge (PARTIAL/FULL) / conflict-win
  branches). `resolve_mass_move` builds one entry per assignment; `resolve_mass_split`
  builds one **or two** (half-prob each) per leg — so a mass split whose every
  leg is single is byte-for-byte a mass move (asserted in
  `tests/test_mass_split.py`). `MassMoveResolution` gained `chosen_to` (the
  winning leg's *intended* destination, = `final_square` unless a CONTACT slide
  stopped short) so the UI can tell the winning branch apart from a *sibling*
  branch of the same source ghost when a split sent one source to two squares.
  Same single-measurement guarantee — `P(solid at s) = mass at s` — so it too
  reduces to today's single move. Headless; covered by `tests/test_mass_split.py`.
- `check.py` — **advisory** check-probability overlay (added 2026-07-11, user
  asked for an interface to "signal check and partial check, like 3/8 to be a
  check" plus a warning before a move exposes their own king). Purely
  informational — no rule impact (see locked decision above). Headless, exact
  `Fraction`s, **no RNG** (it's the *expected* danger, not a rolled outcome).
  Metric (**rewritten 2026-07-11** after a playtest showed the readout
  over-counting — the user: "it should represent the probability that the king
  will be captured if opponent plays his strongest move"): the danger is now the
  **single strongest enemy move**, not any aggregate over independent threats —
  `check_probability(qb, color) = max over every enemy move m of P(m captures the king)`.
  The opponent gets **one** move, so two separate attackers aiming at the king
  do **not** compound (the earlier metric's within-square `1 − ∏(1 − a_i)` was
  exactly that bug — it summed threats the enemy can't all play at once). Each
  move's capture probability is computed **exactly** from the engine's own path-
  collapse rules (`strongest_threat`/`_path_capture_part`): for an enemy ghost of
  presence `p` sliding `from→to` along path squares, walk the path in travel
  order and take
  `p · Σ over king ghosts on square s_k of q(s_k) · ∏ over each *other* piece X
  with ghosts strictly before s_k of (1 − X's total ghost mass there)`. King
  locations are **mutually exclusive** (weights `q(s_k)` sum to 1), so conditioned
  on "king is on `s_k`" every *earlier* king ghost on the path is empty and drops
  out of the blocker product — only non-king, non-attacker pieces block; the
  attacker's own ghosts are passed through. This makes a **single slide that
  sweeps several king ghosts** (e.g. a rook down a file the king is superposed
  along) read as a certain capture, while two king ghosts needing two *different*
  moves take the **max** (no sum). A blocking piece with several ghosts on the
  path blocks with prob = the *sum* of those masses (its locations are mutually
  exclusive too — the sequential renormalization works out to exactly this),
  while distinct pieces are independent, hence the ∏ over X. Moves are enumerated
  by **reusing `rules.ghost_destinations`** (solid blockers already prune each ray
  via the oracle board, so only partial ghosts enter the products), and the
  metric ignores `move.kind` entirely — it only needs `from`/`to` and the path,
  so it automatically covers a solid-king CAPTURE_SOLID, a superposed-king
  CONTACT, a pawn's diagonal, etc. **Mass movement** (when the dial is on, passed
  as `mass_movement=True`): a superposed enemy piece's strongest king threat is
  `Σ over its ghosts g of p_g · (best single leg of g, assuming g is certainly
  present)` — a *sum* over the mutually-exclusive categorical-roll outcomes, each
  taking that ghost's best-capturing destination (the winning ghost resolves its
  slide with the mover certain). This can strictly beat any single move (two
  ghosts covering the king from opposite sides guarantee a capture) and is folded
  into the same max. `strongest_threat` returns a `KingThreat` (prob + attacker +
  `from`/`to`, or `is_mass`) with a `describe()` label ("R a4->e1" / "R mass") so
  the side-panel readout can **name the strongest move**, not just its
  probability. `move_self_check(qb, move, mass_movement=False)` answers "does this
  move expose *my* king?": it builds a hypothetical board via `_hypothetical_after`
  (deep-copy, relocate the mover to its destination, drop a solid piece it
  captures outright, drag a castling rook) and re-runs `check_probability` for
  the mover's colour — catching both moving into fire and discovered exposure
  (a blocker leaving a line). It approximates the move as simply completing;
  the random collapse a CONTACT move might itself trigger is not rolled. UI wiring
  (`app.py::_check_readout`/`_selfcheck_by_square`, `ui/skins/base.py::_check_values`)
  threads `config.mass_movement` through so the readout/warnings account for the
  dial. `tests/test_check.py` asserts the new max-not-compound semantics (two
  half-threats → 1/2 not 3/4; two king ghosts on two lines → max 2/3; one slide
  sweeping two king ghosts → certain 1; a mass move beating a single move → 1).
- `game.py` — `random_selfplay` (M1, classical-only driver used by M1 tests/demo).
- `persistence.py` — save/load a game to/from JSON. Headless like the rest of
  the engine; `to_dict`/`from_dict` snapshot the board (pieces + ghosts, exact
  `Fraction` probabilities), the `GameConfig` dials, and the RNG's internal
  state (`random.Random.getstate()`/`setstate()`) so a resumed game's future
  collapses draw the same sequence they would have if it had never been
  closed. Deliberately excludes UI-transient state (current click selection,
  in-progress split picker, the collapse-animation reveal queue) — `qb` is
  already fully resolved the instant a move applies, so none of that is needed
  to correctly resume play. `save_game`/`load_game` wrap `to_dict`/`from_dict`
  with file I/O (`save_game` creates parent dirs; `load_game` raises on an
  unrecognized `version` field, checked so old/corrupt saves fail loudly
  rather than silently misloading). Each piece dict also carries `has_moved`
  (added 2026-07-11 for castling); `from_dict` reads it with `.get(..., False)`
  rather than a hard key lookup, same reasoning as the theme fields below — a
  save from before this field existed just loads as "never moved," which is
  never *wrong* for a piece that's still on its home square (the only case
  that matters for castling eligibility) and merely conservative-safe
  otherwise. No `version` bump, same precedent as the theme fields. The
  `config` sub-dict also carries
  `theme`/`white_name`/`black_name`/`white_color`/`black_color`; `from_dict`
  reads these with `.get(..., default)` (not a hard key lookup) so old saves
  written before 2026-07-11 still load — they just fall back to
  origin/"White"/"Black" instead of raising, deliberately not a `version` bump
  since the schema only grew optional fields. Separately, `save_teams`/
  `load_teams` (own `TEAMS_FORMAT_VERSION`, single slot `saves/teams.json`)
  round-trip just the *cosmetic team identity* — theme + both names + both
  colours — independent of any game in progress, so players can reuse a
  favourite team look across matches without retyping it in the menu. Driven
  straight from the menu's own fields (plain kwargs, not a `GameConfig`) so it
  stays pygame-free; colours come back as `(r,g,b)` tuples. Added 2026-07-11
  per the user's ask for a save/load-teams button.
  `save_last_settings`/`load_last_settings` (added 2026-07-13, own
  `LAST_SETTINGS_FORMAT_VERSION`, single slot `saves/last_settings.json`) is a
  *superset* of the teams round-trip that also carries every dial
  (`collapse_mode`/`splitting_enabled`/`mass_movement`/`mass_split`) — written
  automatically (not on an explicit button) by `Menu._finalize` every time
  Start/New Game/Resume is clicked, and loaded automatically by
  `Menu._load_startup_defaults` when a fresh pre-game menu opens, so the whole
  menu reopens exactly as it was last left with no save step to remember.
  Deliberately does **not** carry the seed — every match still gets a fresh
  random one. `load_last_settings` reads every field via `.get(..., default)`
  off a throwaway `GameConfig()`, a grow-only schema like the teams file (no
  `version` bump as new dials are added).
- `ui/` — pygame layer (Milestone 4). **The only place that imports pygame** —
  never import it from the engine modules above.
  - **Graphics overhaul (added 2026-07-12)** — user asked to make the game less
    pixelated / prettier and to add selectable piece sets. Three pillars:
    - `pieces.py` — the **piece-set registry/renderer**, the single place that
      turns a `(ptype, color)` into board art. Sets: `cburnett`/`merida` (real
      Lichess SVGs bundled under `ui/assets/pieces/<set>/{wP..bK}.svg`,
      rasterized at the exact pixel size via `pygame.image.load_sized_svg` — no
      Cairo/`cairosvg` dep, and crisp at any size), `neon` (generated at runtime:
      each cburnett silhouette recoloured to the side's `theme.WHITE_NEON`/
      `BLACK_NEON` via a numpy-free `_recolor` — BLEND_RGBA_MAX floods rgb to
      white keeping each pixel's alpha, then BLEND_RGBA_MULT stamps that alpha
      onto a flat colour fill — plus a glow), `tiger` (added 2026-07-14, see
      below), and `unicode` (the original glyph
      look, drawn by the font path). A set is either *literal* (its SVGs are
      drawn as-is: cburnett/merida) or *tinted* (`_TINTED`, a `{set -> base set
      supplying the shapes}` map: neon borrows cburnett's silhouettes, tiger has
      its own) — `render_art` recolours a tinted set to `theme.team_neon(color)`.
      `render_token` composites a soft drop
      shadow (classic sets), a coloured glow (neon), or a contrast rim (tiger)
      via `gaussian_blur`, cached.
      Two caches: raw SVG rasters keyed `(set, code, size)` (theme-independent,
      never invalidated) and composited tokens keyed by a revision counter that
      `set_active` bumps (so a mid-match theme/colour/set change repaints without
      stale neon colours while the expensive raster survives). Adding a future
      thematic set = drop its SVGs in a folder + one `(key, label)` line in
      `PIECE_SETS`. Called via `render.draw_token`'s art branch (extracted as
      `render.blit_piece_art`, reused by the HUD/Clarity skins' own `draw_token`,
      which draw the art for every set except `unicode` — the art itself carries
      the side, so no token circle). The promotion picker and removed-pieces tray
      also render the active set's art. The active set is **per side** (each team
      picks its own figures, added 2026-07-12) — `_active` is a
      `{colour -> set}` map, `pieces.active(color)` reads it, and
      `pieces.set_active(white, black)` sets it (called next to every
      `theme.apply_theme(...)` — main.py, `App.load_from`/`_handle_settings_click`
      — as `set_active(config.white_piece_set, config.black_piece_set)`). Every
      renderer that branches on the set (`render.draw_token`/`blit_piece_art`/
      `draw_promotion_picker`, the skins' `draw_token`) passes the piece's
      `color`, so White can be `cburnett` while Black is `neon` on the same board.
    - **The `tiger` set** (added 2026-07-14, user supplied `assets/tiger_set.png`
      — a sheet of tiger-themed figures — and asked for SVGs of them as a new
      set): crowned tiger faces for the king/queen, a tiger profile for the
      knight, a stylized flame/leaf bishop, a striped rook, a paw pawn. The sheet
      is a **raster**, so the SVGs were **vector-traced** from it by
      `tools/trace_tiger.py` (build-time only, needs `potracer`+`pillow`+`numpy`;
      the game itself never imports them — it just loads the committed SVGs).
      The tracer splits the sheet into figures by ink-projection row/column
      gaps, traces each into Béziers (note: `potrace.Bitmap` inverts internally,
      so it must be handed the **negated** ink mask, else it traces the
      background), and writes all six into **one shared square canvas** so the
      sheet's own relative piece sizes survive the rasterizer's fit-to-token-box
      — except the paw, scaled ×1.6 (at the sheet's 0.39-of-a-king it read as a
      speck on the board). The art has **no light/dark pair**, only one
      silhouette per piece, so tiger is a **tinted** set (`_TINTED`): `w*.svg`
      and `b*.svg` hold the same shape and the colour comes from each team's own
      colour at runtime, exactly like neon. Because a team colour can land
      anywhere on the light/dark range (a pale tiger would vanish on a light
      square), `render_token` gives it a **contrast rim** — the silhouette
      recoloured to `theme.ink_for(tint)` (renamed from the private `_ink_for`
      to be reusable here), blurred and blitted 3× so it's near-opaque at the
      edge and fades out softly. On cyberpunk that rim reads as a glow for free.
    - **`theme.SCALE` supersampling** — the whole game frame is drawn at
      `SCALE`× (=2) the base layout resolution onto an offscreen surface, then
      smooth-scaled to fit the window (see `present.py`) — downscaling a 2x
      render = free SSAA, and an upscale to a big monitor stays smooth instead
      of the old `pygame.SCALED` nearest-neighbour blockiness. **All game
      geometry constants in `theme.py` are `× SCALE`**; because `SCALE` is a
      *static* constant (fixed at import), the module-level copies the skins
      capture at import time (`base.py`'s `SQUARE`/`WINDOW_W`/...) already see the
      scaled values — no runtime plumbing. Skin **font sizes** and every stray
      pixel-literal (panel Y-flows, stroke widths, chip padding, radii) are
      wrapped in `theme.px(n)` = `round(n*SCALE)` so they scale with the frame —
      this was a large but mechanical pass across `render.py`/`base.py`/`hud.py`/
      `clarity.py` (the skins' panels are authored in absolute pixels like the
      menu, so they'd otherwise cram into the top fifth with 2x fonts
      overflowing). `theme.MENU_W`/`MENU_H` are the base (unscaled) window size:
      the pre-game / Settings menu is authored at that resolution on its own
      surface and smooth-scaled the same way (so `menu.py`'s many absolute
      literals stayed untouched). `theme.THEME_NAME` (set by `apply_theme`) lets
      `App.draw` overlay a cached `render.draw_vignette` on the cyberpunk theme.
    - `present.py` — physical-window presentation. Everything draws onto offscreen
      *logical* surfaces (the game at `WINDOW_W×WINDOW_H`, the menu at
      `MENU_W×MENU_H`); `present(window, source)` smooth-scales the source to fit
      the OS window letterboxed, and `to_logical(pos)` maps a physical click back
      onto whichever surface was last presented. The window is **resizable /
      fullscreen-toggleable** (F11); `main.py` and `App.run` translate every
      `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` through `to_logical` before dispatch and recreate the
      window on `VIDEORESIZE`. This replaced the fixed-size `set_mode(..., SCALED)`
      window. **F11 goes through `present.toggle_fullscreen(window)`** (explicit
      `set_mode((0,0), FULLSCREEN)` / restore the windowed size), not
      `pygame.display.toggle_fullscreen()` — the latter misbehaved with a manually
      presented window; `VIDEORESIZE` is ignored while `present.is_fullscreen()`.
      **Any live mouse read must translate too**: `BaseSkin.hover_square` maps
      `pygame.mouse.get_pos()` through `to_logical` before `square_at_pixel`,
      otherwise the hover highlight lands on the wrong square (a bug from the
      first cut of this layer). Tests are unaffected: they drive
      `handle_mouse_down` directly in scaled logical space (clicking
      `render.square_rect(...).center`), never touching the physical translation.
    - `config.GameConfig.white_piece_set`/`black_piece_set` (both default
      `"cburnett"`, with a `piece_set(color)` accessor) carry the per-team choice;
      round-tripped by `persistence.py` (game saves *and* the cosmetic
      `save_teams`/`load_teams`). Backward-compat: a save/team file written with
      the **old single `piece_set` key** loads it for *both* sides
      (`.get("white_piece_set", .get("piece_set", "cburnett"))`); absent
      entirely it falls back to cburnett — no version bump, same precedent as the
      theme fields. The menu (`menu.py`) has **two piece-set rows** (one per team,
      each a team-name label + one button per set with a king preview drawn in
      that team's colour), and the "⇄" swap trades the two sides' sets along with
      their names/colours.
  - `theme.py` — layout/color constants, the glyph map (`♔♕♖♗♘♙`, tinted per
    side rather than relying on separate black/white codepoints — see font note
    below). Two swappable presets, **origin** (the original wood-board look)
    and **cyberpunk** (neon-on-dark). `apply_theme(name, white_color,
    black_color)` rebuilds the whole palette dict and does `globals().update()`
    — every other UI module reads palette values as `theme.X` (attribute
    lookup, never `from theme import X`), so one call after the menu closes
    (or after `App.load_from`, in case a save carries a different theme) repaints
    everything with no plumbing through render.py/app.py/menu.py. Cyberpunk's
    palette is generated, not hardcoded per colour: `_cyberpunk_palette` mixes
    each player's chosen `white_color`/`black_color` with fixed dark/light grays
    (`_mix`/`_clamp`) to build the board squares (blend of both teams' hues into
    the grid), each side's token fill/border, and an ink colour picked for
    contrast (`_ink_for`, luminance-based) — so an arbitrarily-picked neon still
    reads against its token. `TERMS` is a second per-theme dict, swapped the
    same way, that reskins the *narration* players see in the side log —
    "captures" → "deletes", a fizzled move's clause, "vanished" branches, the
    win line, and the collapse status line's "IS"/"is NOT" → "ONLINE"/"OFFLINE"
    — added because a reused colour palette alone didn't feel "cyberpunk enough"
    once the boards were side by side. `castle_verb` ("castles"/"reroutes",
    added 2026-07-11) follows the same pattern for the new castling log line.
    `check_word`/`safe_word` ("CHECK"/"safe" vs "LOCKED ON"/"clear", added
    2026-07-11) reskin the advisory check-probability readout the same way.
    `TERMS` also carries the on-board
    collapse-caption words (`reveal_present`/`reveal_absent`/`reveal_capture` —
    "REAL!"/"EMPTY"/"CAPTURED!" vs "ONLINE"/"OFFLINE"/"DELETED!"). `SWATCHES` is
    the curated 8-colour list the menu's colour pickers offer (free-text hex was
    considered and skipped as unnecessary polish for a 2-player hotseat game).
    `EVENT_PRESENT_COLOR`/`EVENT_ABSENT_COLOR` are the green/red collapse-flash
    hues (per theme). `LOG_KEYWORD_COLORS` (added 2026-07-11, user asked for
    the side-log's narration keywords to be colorized) maps each `TERMS` key
    (`capture_verb`, `split_verb`, `castle_verb`, `win_suffix`,
    `fizzle_clause`, `vanished_word`, ...) to a colour already in the
    palette — captures/deletes reuse `EVENT_ABSENT_COLOR` (the same red as a
    negative collapse flash), a split/fork reuses `SPLIT_PICK_RING`, a win
    reuses `SELECTED_RING` (same gold as the win banner), and `vanished_word`
    ("vanished"/"glitched out") reuses `LEGAL_CONTACT_DOT` (the risky-contact
    orange, not a dim tone — user asked for it to stand out too, since a
    split branch that didn't survive is worth noticing) — via a shared
    `_keyword_colors(palette)` helper both `_origin_palette`/
    `_cyberpunk_palette` call, so a new keyword only needs one new mapping,
    not per-theme duplication. `WHITE_LABEL`/`BLACK_LABEL` + the
    `theme.team_label(color)` helper (added 2026-07-11, user asked for team
    names to render in their team colour) give each side's *name text* a
    per-theme colour: origin uses a warm cream / lightened wood-brown pair
    (legible on the dark panel, since the raw black token is unreadable there);
    cyberpunk uses each side's own vivid neon accent (`white_color`/
    `black_color`). Applied by render.py to the turn title, the removed-pieces
    tray headers, the win banner, and inline in the side-log (team names are
    fed to `draw_log_line` as extra colour spans alongside the `TERMS`
    keywords).
  - `animation.py` — **pygame-free** collapse-animation *model* (like the
    engine). `Token`/`Beat` dataclasses + `build_animation(before, movers,
    events)`, which turns a resolved move/split into a beat script: one TRAVEL
    beat (the mover, or both split branches, slides out from the source) then one
    FLASH beat per `CollapseEvent`. It reconstructs each beat's static `rest`
    layer from the *pre-resolve* snapshot plus the movers, evolving it event by
    event — that's what keeps a split branch that will vanish visible until its
    own flash fades it (the engine already dropped it instantly). Fades come
    from `CollapseEvent.removed`, shatters from `captured_square`; a confirmed
    mover goes solid in `rest` on its own flash. Durations vary by slide
    distance / whether the beat also removes something ("variable by
    complexity"). Unit-tested headlessly in `tests/test_animation.py`.
  - `render.py` — pure drawing functions (board, ghost tokens with alpha ∝
    probability + fraction label, same-piece aura outlines, legal-destination
    dots colour-coded safe/merge/**risky-contact**, side panel, promotion
    picker). Nothing here mutates state. (**Cleanup 2026-07-12**: the pre-skin
    single-render-path functions `draw_board`/`draw_highlights`/`draw_pieces`/
    `_draw_anim_token`/`draw_beat`/`draw_side_panel` — plus the dead `theme.THEMES`
    constant, `animation.total_duration`, and `BaseSkin._round_card` — were
    **removed as dead code**: every skin now owns its board/piece/panel drawing
    via `base.py` + `hud.py`/`clarity.py`, calling the smaller `render.*`
    primitives directly. References to those removed functions in the paragraphs
    below are historical; the primitives they described —
    `draw_log_line`/`_log_keyword_spans`/`_draw_danger_marker`/`frac_str`/
    `draw_token`/`draw_flash`/`shatter`/`caption` etc. — are still live and
    called by the skins.) `draw_token` is the shared token
    renderer (used by both the live board and the animation); `draw_beat(surface,
    beat, t, fonts)` draws one animation beat at progress `t` — rest tokens,
    sliding travel tokens (smoothstep-eased), fading `removed` ghosts, a capture
    `shatter` (fading token + expanding ring), the green/red square flash, and a
    floating caption chip. `draw_log_line(surface, text, pos, font,
    default_color, name_colors=None)` (added 2026-07-11, alongside
    `LOG_KEYWORD_COLORS` above) renders one side-log line with its theme
    keywords in colour: helper `_log_keyword_spans(text, extra_specs=())`
    searches `text` for every `theme.TERMS` value *plus* any `extra_specs`
    `(text, color)` pairs (longest first, so a multi-word phrase like
    `win_suffix` isn't shadowed by a shorter keyword sitting inside it, nor a
    team name by a keyword inside it), keeps only non-overlapping matches, and
    `draw_log_line` blits the line as alternating default-colour/keyword-colour
    segments instead of one `font.render` call. `draw_side_panel` passes the
    two team names as `name_colors` (`{name: theme.team_label(color)}`) so a
    name reads in its team colour inline in the log too (see `theme.py`'s
    `WHITE_LABEL`/`BLACK_LABEL` above). `draw_side_panel`'s log
    loop (was a single `fonts["small"].render(line, ...)` per wrapped line)
    calls this instead. A keyword split across a word-wrap boundary just
    doesn't get coloured on that render — the panel is wide enough that this
    hasn't come up in practice, not worth solving. **Check overlay** (added
    2026-07-11): `draw_side_panel` takes `show_check`/`check_lines` and draws a
    "Check warnings: ON/OFF (K)" toggle (`panel_rects()["check"]`) plus, above
    the config line, one `(text, color)` readout line per king (danger-red when
    threatened, dim when safe). `draw_highlights` takes an optional
    `check_by_square`/`fonts`: for each destination in it, `_draw_danger_marker`
    overlays a red warning ring + a `frac_str` chip (the mover's own resulting
    check probability) on top of the normal legal-move dot.
  - `app.py` — `App`: click-driven interaction (select → move or split → collapse
    animation), promotion picker, side log. Both players see the *entire* board
    including all ghosts/probabilities at all times (hotseat, no hidden
    information) — only the collapse dice roll is unknown until resolved.
    Collapse animation: right before resolving, `_execute_move`/`_handle_split_click`
    snapshot the board (`_snapshot_tokens`) and, after, build a beat script via
    `animation.build_animation` (`self._beats`, current = `[0]`). `update(dt)`
    advances `_beat_elapsed` and drains finished beats (a single long frame can
    drain several short beats); `draw` renders the current beat via
    `render.draw_beat` *instead of* the live pieces while `is_animating()`, then
    hands back to the normal board once `_beats` empties (`qb` is already the
    final state throughout). Any click / the New Game / Escape paths flush via
    `_flush_animation` (skip to end) — a winning move's animation still can't be
    skipped past into New Game. **Quiet relocate/merge moves (zero events)
    resolve instantly (no beats), so ordinary play stays snappy; only a move that
    actually measured something — and *every* split (both branches always slide
    out) — animates.** A completed castle is a third exception to the "quiet
    moves are instant" rule (added 2026-07-11): `_execute_move` snapshots the
    rook's pre-move `Token` too and, if `move.castle_rook` completed (checked
    by whether the rook ghost actually landed on `rook_to`, not just
    `has_moved`, to stay independent of the flag's exact semantics), passes
    *both* the king's and rook's `(dest_token, from_square)` pairs into
    `build_animation` — same mechanism `_handle_split_click` already uses for
    a split's two branches — so both pieces always slide even when the path
    was completely clear and there's nothing to flash. The side-log line for a
    completed castle uses the new `theme.TERMS['castle_verb']`
    ("castles"/"reroutes") and names the rook's own move too.
    `App.save_to`/`App.load_from` wrap `persistence.save_game`/`load_game`
    against a single quicksave slot (`DEFAULT_SAVE_PATH = saves/quicksave.json`);
    wired to both panel buttons (`self.skin.panel_rects()["save"/"load"]` —
    see `skins/` below) and `F5`/`F9`. `load_from` catches
    `OSError`/`ValueError`/`KeyError` (missing file, unknown version,
    malformed JSON) and logs a message instead of crashing the app.
    `App._piece_label` and every side-log line read team names/verbs off
    `self.config.team_name(color)` / `theme.TERMS[...]` rather than
    hardcoding "White"/"Black"/"captures" — see `theme.py` above.
    **Check overlay wiring** (added 2026-07-11): `show_check` (default on,
    toggled by the panel button / `K`). `_check_readout()` builds the two
    per-king readout lines from `check.check_probability`; `_selfcheck_by_square()`
    returns `{to_square -> Fraction}` for the current *move-mode* selection's
    destinations that would *raise* the mover's own king danger above its
    current baseline (via `check.move_self_check`) — the feature-2 warning set.
    Both are cached and keyed on a `self._ply` counter bumped on every board
    change (move/split resolve, new_game, load_from), so the per-destination
    board deep-copies and the readout aren't recomputed each frame. Split mode
    shows the readout but no per-branch warnings (a split leaves half the mass
    on the source, so it barely opens a line — deliberately out of scope).
    **Skin switching** (added 2026-07-11, see `skins/` below): `self.skins`
    (all registered skins), `self.skin_index`, `self.skin` (the active one)
    are built in `__init__` — there is no more "no skin" classic render
    path; `draw()` is just `self.skin.draw(self)`. `App.cycle_skin()`
    advances to the next skin; wired to the **Tab** key and to a `"view"`
    key in `handle_mouse_down`'s rect dict, hit-tested like
    save/load/captured/check (reachable any time, not gated on whose turn it
    is or game-over). A display preference, like `show_captured`/
    `show_check` — untouched by `new_game`/`load_from`.
    **In-game Settings** (added 2026-07-11, user asked to be able to change
    colours/team name etc. mid-match instead of only pre-game): `open_settings()`
    reopens `ui/menu.py`'s `Menu` (see its own entry below) as a full-screen
    overlay, constructed with `in_game=True, initial_config=self.config` so it
    opens pre-filled with the match's *current* dials/theme/names/colours
    rather than the last saved team file. `self.in_settings`/`self.settings_menu`
    gate everything: `draw()` renders `self.settings_menu.draw()` instead of
    the skin entirely while open (same "takes over the whole window" pattern
    as the pre-game menu, not squeezed into the side panel), and `run()`
    routes `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` to `_handle_settings_click` instead of
    `handle_mouse_down` whenever `in_settings`. `handle_keydown` special-cases
    `in_settings` up front: `Escape` closes Settings and discards every edit
    (`self.config` is untouched until a button is actually clicked), `F11`
    still toggles fullscreen, anything else forwards to
    `self.settings_menu.handle_keydown` (so the team-name text fields keep
    working) — normal game hotkeys (`M`/`C`/`K`/...) don't fire while the
    screen is open. Reachable via a "Settings (O)" panel button (hit-tested
    like `view`/`quit`, so it isn't gated on whose turn it is or game-over
    either) or the **O** key; both routes go through `open_settings()`, which
    is a no-op mid-animation (same guard as Save/Load) so a collapse reveal
    can't be interrupted. `_handle_settings_click` reads the `(action, config)`
    tuple `Menu.handle_click` now returns (see `menu.py` below) and always
    calls `theme.apply_theme(...)` for the edited config, then branches:
    `"resume"` just swaps in `self.config` and logs "Settings updated." —
    `qb`/turn/log/mode are left completely alone, so changing a team's colour
    mid-game doesn't cost either player their position; `"new_game"` calls
    `new_game(config)` — `App.new_game` gained an optional `config` param for
    this (previously always reseeded the rng randomly while keeping whatever
    config was already set, which is still exactly what the no-arg post-win
    "New Game (N)" button/key do; passed a config, it instead adopts it and
    seeds the rng from `config.seed`, deterministic like a menu-driven start)
    — resets the board with the edited dials, exactly like starting over from
    the pre-game menu.
    **Mass-move planning** (added 2026-07-11, `mass_movement` dial): when the
    dial is on, clicking a *superposed* own piece opens planning instead of an
    ordinary one-click move/split (a solid piece still moves/splits the
    ordinary way — planning only makes sense for >1 ghost). This is
    independent of the top-level Move/Split toggle (fixed 2026-07-13 — user
    report: "I turn on split, move one ghost and the turn ends, I didn't get
    a chance to split the second ghost" — the original check required
    `mode == "move"` to enter planning, so a player who switched to Split
    mode first, expecting that to be how you split *multiple* ghosts, instead
    fell through to an ordinary single-ghost split and lost the turn after
    touching only one ghost). *Entry* is mode-independent, but **inside** a
    plan the toggle keeps its ordinary meaning: it says whether the ghost
    you're currently aiming **moves** (one click, commits immediately) or
    **splits** (the two-pick gesture) — see `App.plan_splitting`/`_plan_cap`
    below — and it stays switchable mid-plan (`toggle_mode` drops any
    half-made assignment but keeps the plan; with `mass_split` *off* the
    toggle can't mean anything inside a plan, so it abandons the plan as
    before and `_begin_plan` forces `mode = "move"` so the panel can't show a
    stale "SPLIT" label). `self.plan` maps every ghost's
    source square → a **tuple** of its chosen destination(s) (all default to
    `(source,)` = "stay"; one square = relocate, or — only with the `mass_split`
    dial on — two distinct squares = that ghost splits in half),
    `self.plan_active` is the ghost being aimed, `self.plan_piece` the piece.
    `_handle_plan_click` cycles select-ghost → pick-target (or click the ghost
    again to hold); `plan_legal()` gives the active ghost's targets in the
    skin's own highlight style (a `CAPTURE_SOLID` is tagged risky, like split,
    since a mass leg's mover isn't guaranteed present). Aiming a ghost *pawn* at
    the promotion rank pops the ordinary promotion picker (`_pending_plan_promo`
    holds the leg until a piece is clicked; `plan_promo[(from, to)]` records the
    choice per branch, pruned via `_prune_promos` if that ghost is later
    re-aimed) so promotions are chosen, not auto-queened.
    **Mass split** (added 2026-07-13, `mass_split` dial layered on
    `mass_movement`): `App.plan_splitting()` (= `can_mass_split()` **and**
    `mode == "split"`) / `_plan_cap()` raise the *active* ghost's destination
    cap from 1 to 2. Splitting a ghost reuses the top-level
    split-mode two-pick gesture, per ghost: `self.plan_pick_a` holds the first
    branch chosen for the active ghost (like `split_pick_a`); clicking a
    *second* square commits a split into both (`plan[from] = (a, b)`), clicking
    the *first square again* commits a plain single move, and clicking the
    ghost's own square first still holds it. `_commit_plan_branch` centralizes
    "record this branch" for both first/second and cap-1/cap-2. Escape backs out
    the in-progress ghost assignment first, then the whole plan. Confirm (a
    floating `render.mass_controls_rects()` button over the board, or `Enter`) →
    `_confirm_plan` builds a `MassMove` (every leg single, `resolve_mass_move`)
    or a `MassSplit` (`resolve_mass_split`, when the dial is on), logs it
    (`theme.TERMS['mass_verb']`/`'mass_split_verb'`/`'mass_collapse_clause'`),
    and animates every moving branch sliding out (the winning branch — matched
    by `result.chosen_from`+`chosen_to` so a split's sibling isn't confused for
    it — lands solid, losers fade; same `build_animation` path as a split's
    branches). Cancel (floating button /
    `Escape`) — or switching to split mode when `mass_split` is off — abandons
    the plan; the plan is
    transient UI state (not persisted, cleared by `new_game`/`load_from`).
    Planning is skin-agnostic — drawn centrally in `BaseSkin.draw`'s
    `is_planning()` branch via `BaseSkin.draw_plan` + `render.draw_plan_rings`/
    `draw_plan_arrows`/`draw_mass_controls`, so both skins get it without
    touching their bespoke panels.
  - `skins/` — one drawing language per view (board + panel), see
    `UI_REDESIGN.md` for the full design history. Started 2026-07-11 as a
    3-variant live-switching demo (`demo_ui.py`, a separate script) to
    playtest looks side by side; after playtesting, **Quantum HUD**
    (`hud.py`) and **Clarity / Data-viz** (`clarity.py`) were kept as the
    two views a player can switch between *during a real match* (see
    `App`'s skin switching above), **Polished Evolution** was dropped, and
    the demo script was deleted — the redesigned UI *is* the main game now;
    `python main.py` runs it directly. `base.py`'s `BaseSkin` still supplies
    the shared contract (hit-testing/geometry, fonts, `_check_values`
    cache, `_hbar`/`_caps_label` helpers) both skins build on;
    each skin owns its own `panel_rects()` (so drawn and clickable
    positions stay in lock-step — `App.handle_mouse_down` always hit-tests
    against `self.skin.panel_rects()`) and a from-scratch `draw_panel`.
    Clarity's turn header (added 2026-07-11) borrows the *structure* of
    HUD's "ACTIVE UNIT" module — a framed block naming whose turn it is
    plus a live mode readout, judged nicer in playtesting than Polished's
    header — but reskinned flat/hairline-bordered/no-glow to match
    Clarity's own data-panel language instead of HUD's console brackets.
    Both skins also gained a `"view"` control (a `CLARITY`/`HUD` segmented
    switch in Clarity, a `[TAB] VIEW` row in HUD) and a `"quit"` button
    (confirm-then-fire, ported from the retired classic path so removing it
    didn't silently drop the feature) in the same pass.
  - `menu.py` — pre-game dial picker (collapse mode, splitting on/off, mass
    moves on/off, mass split on/off, seed, board theme, team names, team
    colours). The "Splitting"/"Mass moves"/"Mass split" toggle row is laid out
    **dynamically** (`Menu._dial_specs`/`_dial_rects`, reworked 2026-07-13 —
    user: "when some option is not available, it should be hidden"): each
    toggle is only included at all once its prerequisite dial is on (mass
    moves needs splitting; mass split needs mass moves), so with a dial off the
    ones that depend on it simply **aren't drawn or clickable**, not just
    dimmed — the row's rects (and its centering) are recomputed on every
    `handle_click`/`draw` call rather than fixed in `__init__`, since how many
    buttons exist depends on the current state. Toggling a dial off also
    cascades the reset onto anything that depends on it (turning Splitting off
    clears `mass_movement`/`mass_split` too; turning Mass moves off clears
    `mass_split`), and `_build_config` re-applies the same AND-gating
    defensively in case a loaded config had them out of sync. `splitting_enabled`
    is enforced at this UI layer (`App.toggle_mode`), not inside the engine —
    the engine's split functions are dial-agnostic by design. Team-name fields are simple
    click-to-focus text inputs (`Menu.active_field` + `handle_keydown`, wired
    from `main.py`'s menu loop since the mouse-only loop never forwarded
    `KEYDOWN` before); team-colour pickers are `theme.SWATCHES` swatches,
    shown only once "Cyberpunk" is the selected theme (origin doesn't use
    custom colours). Both team-colour swatch rows and the theme toggle read
    back into the `GameConfig` the Start button returns. A "Save Teams" /
    "Load Teams" button pair (flanking "Reroll seed" on one row) persists the
    current team setup (theme + names + colours) via `persistence.save_teams`/
    `load_teams`; Load writes the saved values straight back into the menu
    fields and a transient `team_status` line reports the result. `Menu.__init__`
    also calls `_load_teams(startup=True)` right after setting the hardcoded
    defaults, so a fresh menu opens pre-filled with whatever team setup was
    last saved instead of always resetting to origin/White/Black — a missing
    or corrupt save is silently ignored at startup (falls back to the
    hardcoded defaults) since `team_status` has nothing worth reporting yet,
    whereas an explicit Load click still surfaces "No saved teams to load."
    Added 2026-07-11 per the user's ask to default menu settings from the last
    team save. A "⇄" swap button (`Menu.swap_rect`, between the two name
    fields) trades the white/black name+colour assignments in one click
    (`Menu._swap_teams`) — since white always moves first, this is how
    players pick who starts without retyping both names. Added 2026-07-11
    per the user's ask for a way to switch who starts.
    **Remembering the last-used settings** (added 2026-07-13, user: "make the
    game remember last settings and load them when app starts"): distinct from
    the explicit Save/Load Teams profile above (a named look a player returns
    to on purpose), this is automatic and covers every dial too, not just
    cosmetics. `Menu._finalize(action)` — now what `handle_click` calls instead
    of returning `(action, self._build_config())` directly for the
    Start/New-Game/Resume buttons — builds the config, calls
    `persistence.save_last_settings(LAST_SETTINGS_PATH, config)` (best-effort;
    an `OSError` is swallowed so a failed remember can't block starting the
    game), then returns the tuple exactly as before. `Menu.__init__`'s
    pre-game branch calls the new `_load_startup_defaults()` instead of
    `_load_teams(startup=True)` directly: it tries `load_last_settings` first
    (every dial + cosmetic field) and only falls back to `_load_teams` (the
    older, cosmetics-only path) if no last-settings file exists yet — so a
    fresh app launch reopens the menu exactly as it was last left, with no
    save button to remember to click. The seed is deliberately excluded from
    both sides of this round-trip (see `persistence.py` above) — every match
    still starts from a fresh random seed.
    **Reused mid-game as the Settings screen** (added 2026-07-11, see
    `app.py`'s in-game Settings writeup above): `Menu.__init__` gained
    `in_game: bool = False` and `initial_config: Optional[GameConfig] = None`.
    `initial_config`, when given, seeds every field from it instead of
    calling `_load_startup_defaults()` — Settings opens showing the match's
    own current dials, not the last remembered/saved setup. `in_game` draws the
    title as "Settings" instead of "Match Setup" and adds a `resume_rect`
    button ("Resume Game") beside the existing Start button (relabeled "New
    Game"); pre-game (`in_game=False`) `resume_rect` is `None` and Start stays
    the single centered button, unchanged. `handle_click`'s return type
    changed from a bare `GameConfig` to `(action, GameConfig)` — `"start"`
    pre-game, `"new_game"`/`"resume"` mid-game depending which of the two
    buttons fired — so a caller can tell "reset the board" apart from "just
    apply these settings" (`main.py`'s pre-game loop unpacks and ignores the
    action, since it's always `"start"` there). Both branches build the
    `GameConfig` via a new `_build_config()` helper factored out of the old
    inline Start-button construction, so Start/New-Game/Resume all stay
    perfectly consistent with each other.
  - Collapse animation plays on the board (see `animation.py`/`render.draw_beat`
    above): movement slides out first, then each measurement flashes green/red
    with fading ghosts, capture shatters and a floating caption. Per-beat
    durations are set in `animation.py` (travel scales with distance; a flash
    that also removes something gets extra time). Any click mid-animation
    flushes the rest instantly (skip).
- `main.py` (repo root) — entry point: `python main.py` (menu → game). Calls
  `theme.apply_theme(config.theme, config.white_color, config.black_color)`
  once the menu's Start button returns a `GameConfig`, before constructing
  `App` — this is the one call site that actually activates a chosen theme.
- `tests/` — plain pytest against the headless engine, plus `test_m4_ui.py`
  which drives `App` headlessly via `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` and simulated clicks
  (`handle_mouse_down` with pixel coords from `render.square_rect(...).center`)
  — real interaction-logic coverage, not just visual inspection. `test_persistence.py`
  covers `persistence.py` directly (no pygame needed): dict round-trip, disk
  round-trip (`tmp_path`), rejecting an unrecognized save-format version, and
  that a resumed RNG continues the *same* future random sequence it would have
  pre-save (the whole point of persisting `rng.getstate()`). `test_animation.py`
  covers the collapse-animation beat builder headlessly (no pygame): travel
  beat + one flash per event, vanished branches routed to fades, captures to a
  shatter, confirmed movers going solid. `test_check.py` covers the advisory
  check-probability overlay headlessly: full check from a solid attacker,
  superposed-attacker scaling, aggregate `1−∏(1−p)` over two threats,
  superposed-king exposure, a partial blocker thinning a threat, and
  `move_self_check` for both discovered exposure and moving into/out of fire.

## Run / test
- **Play the game**: `python main.py` (needs a real display — pick dials in the menu, then click to play)
- Demo (M1 random game): `python demo_m1.py [seed]`
- Demo (M2 superposition): `python demo_m2.py`
- Demo (M3 collapse): `python demo_m3.py [seed]` — try seeds 1-5, each gives a different outcome
- Tests: `python -m pytest -q`  (214 passing). UI tests need `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` in
  the environment (set automatically at the top of `test_m4_ui.py`, but harmless to
  also export it yourself: `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy python -m pytest -q`).
- `HOW_TO_PLAY.md` (repo root) — player-facing rules/controls guide for the user and their friend.

## Milestone status
- [x] **M1** — headless board model + classical movement (capture-the-king), ASCII
      demo, tests. All green.
- [x] **M2** — superposition: split, merge, ghost/probability bookkeeping (exact
      `Fraction`s), ghost-aware move generation, ASCII ghost view. Contact with a
      foreign ghost is detected and deferred to M3. All green.
- [x] **M3** — collapse: contact + path collapse (multiple pieces can collapse in
      one move), both modes (partial/full), seedable RNG (`random.Random` passed
      in explicitly — trivially mockable in tests), win-by-king-capture through
      collapse. Deterministic mechanism tests (via a `ScriptedRng` test double)
      plus a statistical test (3000 trials, 50% ghost captures ~50% of the time).
      All green.
- [x] **M4** — pygame UI: board, ghost tokens (alpha ∝ probability, fraction
      labels, same-piece aura outlines), click-to-select with legal-destination
      highlighting (safe/merge/risky-contact colour-coded), split mode
      (two-click destination picker), promotion picker, side log, on-board
      collapse animation (movement-then-reveal: slide → green/red flash → fading
      ghosts → capture shatter → floating caption; click-to-skip), game-over
      banner, pre-game dial menu. Verified via headless PNG screenshots (visual)
      and `test_m4_ui.py` (functional, simulated clicks under `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`).
      All green. User did a first interactive playtest 2026-07-11 ("looks like
      it works"); a follow-up self-review pass then found and fixed three real
      UX gaps: Escape used to quit the whole app instead of cancelling the
      current selection (`App.cancel_selection`), there was no way to start a
      new game after a win (`App.new_game`, "New Game (N)" button), and the
      Move/Split toggle was keyboard-only (now also a clickable panel button,
      `render.panel_rects()["mode"]`). Also fixed: a winning move's own collapse
      animation could be skipped past via the New Game button — animation now
      always takes priority over both New Game and Escape. A second playtest
      2026-07-11 turned up a display-only bug: the side-log always printed
      `(1/2), (1/2)` for a split, even when splitting an already-partial ghost
      (should show 1/4 for a ghost that was already at 1/2). The engine math in
      `rules.py::apply_split` was correct throughout (`half = source.prob / 2`);
      the log line in `app.py::_handle_split_click` just hardcoded the string
      instead of reading the resulting `Ghost.prob` back off the board. Fixed
      by reading the actual post-split probabilities via the new public
      `render.frac_str()` (renamed from `_frac_str`). Transcript saved at
      `games/2026-07-11_split-fraction-log-bug.md`. That same playtest also
      surfaced a real interaction bug: `App.mode` ("move"/"split") was never
      reset after a turn completed, so once either player used split mode it
      silently stayed in split mode for the *other* player's next turn too —
      clicking an opponent's piece to capture then read as "pick an illegal
      split target," which fails closed by clearing the whole selection
      (looks like the click just did nothing / "reverted"). Fixed by resetting
      `self.mode = "move"` at the end of `_execute_move` and
      `_handle_split_click` in `app.py`, so every new turn starts in move mode
      by default and split must be re-chosen each time it's wanted. That same
      day, added a save/load mechanism (`quantumchess/persistence.py` +
      `App.save_to`/`App.load_from`, "Save (F5)"/"Load (F9)" panel buttons) —
      motivated by wanting to resume that same game after the app was closed
      before it could be reconstructed by hand. Single quicksave slot at
      `saves/quicksave.json`; round-trips board state (exact `Fraction`
      probabilities), config dials, and RNG state so a resumed game's future
      collapses are exactly as random as an uninterrupted one. 65 tests passing.
      Later the same day, added a second board theme, **cyberpunk** (neon-on-dark),
      alongside the original look (now called **origin**) — user-requested, with
      per-match team customization: players pick a team name and an accent
      colour each in the pre-game menu (`ui/menu.py`), and the cyberpunk palette
      is generated from those two colours blended with grays rather than being
      a second hardcoded palette (`ui/theme.py::_cyberpunk_palette`). Team names
      replace the hardcoded "White"/"Black" everywhere they're displayed
      (`GameConfig.team_name`), and a per-theme `TERMS` dict reskins the side-log
      narration too (e.g. "captures" → "deletes" in cyberpunk) — added after the
      user specifically asked for terminology to be part of the theme, not just
      colours. `GameConfig` gained `theme`/`white_name`/`black_name`/
      `white_color`/`black_color`, persisted via `persistence.py` with
      `.get(..., default)` fallbacks so pre-existing saves still load. 75 tests
      passing. Later 2026-07-11, the collapse resolution got a proper **on-board
      animation** (user asked to make collapses readable): movement-first, then
      per-measurement reveals — both split branches (or the mover) slide out,
      then each measured square flashes green (really there) / red (not there),
      wiped ghosts fade, a captured piece shatters, and a short caption floats
      over the action. Chosen choreography = full slide+flash+fade+caption,
      pacing = variable by complexity (`AskUserQuestion`). Architecture: engine
      `CollapseEvent` enriched with `removed`/`captured_square` (still headless);
      new pygame-free `ui/animation.py` builds a beat script from a before-snapshot
      + the events; `render.draw_beat` draws it; `app.py` drives it beat by beat.
      Quiet moves (no measurement) stay instant. 83 tests passing. Later the
      same day, the menu was changed to default its team fields from the last
      `saves/teams.json` save (see `ui/menu.py` above) instead of always
      resetting to origin/White/Black, so a returning pair of players don't
      have to re-pick their theme/names/colours every session. 85 tests
      passing. Later 2026-07-11, split gained the option to leave one branch
      at the piece's own square (user asked to be able to "add current
      position to one of the target possibilities") — previously
      `legal_split_targets`/`ghost_destinations` never offered a piece's own
      square since a normal move can't target where it already is. Fixed at
      the rules layer: `legal_split_targets` (`rules.py`) now prepends
      `square` itself to the candidate list, and `split_destination_kind`
      special-cases `to_square == square` as a measurement-free `RELOCATE`
      (nothing else can occupy a square the piece's own ghost is already on,
      so it's always safe) — `apply_split`/`collapse.resolve_split` needed no
      changes beyond that, since both already re-check occupancy at each
      destination *after* removing the source ghost first. UI-side,
      `app.py::_legal_by_square` adds the source square to the split-mode
      destination dict, and `handle_mouse_down`'s "click the selected square
      to deselect" shortcut is now suppressed in split mode (`square ==
      self.selected and self.mode != "split"`) so that click reaches
      `_handle_split_click` as a "stay here" pick instead of clearing the
      selection — Escape still cancels normally. 87 tests passing. Later
      2026-07-11, **castling** was added (previously a deferred, unbuilt dial —
      see `rules.py`/`collapse.py`/`model.py`/`app.py`/`theme.py` above for the
      full writeup) after the user reached a real playtest position where it
      should have been legal and asked whether it should be possible. Locked
      with the user beforehand: castling only for a king/rook that has *never*
      moved or split, ever (`Piece.has_moved`); squares between king and rook
      may hold ghosts (resolved by walking the king's own path with the same
      machinery as any sliding `CONTACT` move — "start evaluation by moving
      the king first"), except the queenside b-file square, which only the
      rook ever crosses and so must be completely empty up front. The rook
      only follows if the king's move/walk reaches the full castle distance
      uncollapsed. 102 tests passing. Later 2026-07-11, the side panel gained a
      **removed pieces** tray (user asked to show captured figures with a show/
      hide toggle): a "Removed pieces: ON/OFF (C)" button
      (`render.panel_rects()["captured"]`, also bound to the `C` key) drawn
      right below Surrender. Sourced straight from `qb.pieces` filtered to
      `not p.alive` — no new engine state needed, since a captured `Piece`
      already just sits `alive=False` in that dict forever, sorted
      queen-to-pawn (`render._CAPTURED_ORDER`) rather than by capture order.
      `App.show_captured` defaults to `True` and isn't reset by
      `new_game`/`load_from` (a display preference, not game state); the
      button is checked in `handle_mouse_down` ahead of the `is_over()` gate
      so it still works after a win, unlike Mode/Surrender. Initially laid out
      as rows above the log; changed same day (user asked for it beside the
      log instead) to a **second column**: below the divider, the panel splits
      into the log (left, narrowed) and a fixed-width tray (right,
      `render._draw_captured_column`, 12px-radius tokens via `draw_token`'s
      new optional `radius` param, default unchanged for the board/animation
      call sites) listing each `config.team_name(color)`'s dead pieces as a
      little icon grid that wraps to further rows on its own, with a thin
      vertical rule between the two columns. Hiding the tray just widens the
      log back to the panel's full width — both columns share the same
      `log_top`/`bottom_limit` vertical extent so there's no separate height
      bookkeeping. 109 tests passing. Later 2026-07-11, an **advisory
      check-probability overlay** was added (`quantumchess/check.py` + UI
      wiring — see the module/`render.py`/`app.py`/`theme.py` notes above)
      after the user asked for "an interface to signal check and partial
      check, like 3/8 to be a check" plus a warning before a move exposes
      their own king. It does **not** reintroduce a check *rule* (the king
      stays freely capturable): it only displays each king's aggregate danger
      (`1−∏(1−p)` over every enemy capturing attempt, metric chosen with the
      user) in the side panel and flags, on the selected piece, every
      destination that would raise the mover's own king danger with a red ring
      + resulting fraction. Toggle: panel button / `K`. 117 tests passing.
      Later 2026-07-11, a playtest found a **pawn move-generation bug**: a pawn's
      diagonal move was offered as a `CONTACT` onto *any* foreign ghost,
      including a **friendly** one (e.g. a7 "capturing" its own forked b7-pawn
      ghost on b6 — an illegal move that the UI accepted). `_pawn_dest`
      (`rules.py`) checked the occupant's colour for a *solid* diagonal blocker
      but not for a *ghost* one; fixed by only emitting the diagonal `CONTACT`
      when `qb.pieces[occ.piece_id].color != color` (an enemy), mirroring the
      friendly-solid `continue` right above it. Fixes both plain moves and split
      targets (both route through `ghost_destinations`). 119 tests passing.
      Later 2026-07-11, a separate **UI redesign playtest** (`UI_REDESIGN.md`,
      `quantumchess/ui/skins/`, run via a standalone `demo_ui.py`) explored
      3 alternate visual languages (Polished Evolution, Quantum HUD,
      Clarity/Data-viz) live-switchable mid-game, plus bespoke side panels
      for each. It concluded the same day: **Polished Evolution dropped**,
      **Quantum HUD and Clarity kept as the two real views**, and the whole
      thing **merged into the main game** — `demo_ui.py` deleted, `App`
      itself now owns skin-switching (`self.skins`/`cycle_skin()`, **Tab** or
      a panel "view" control, live mid-match, see `ui/app.py`/`ui/skins/`
      above). Clarity's turn header was rebuilt around HUD's "ACTIVE UNIT"
      structure (judged nicer than Polished's) reskinned to Clarity's own
      flat language; a "Quit" button (previously only reachable through the
      now-deleted classic render path) was ported to both surviving skins
      so the merge didn't silently drop it. `test_m4_ui.py` now hit-tests
      through `app.skin.panel_rects()` instead of the old canonical
      `render.panel_rects()`. 119 tests passing (unchanged count — a
      like-for-like swap of which panel geometry the clicks target, not new
      coverage). Later 2026-07-11, a playtest crashed the app: splitting a
      king toward a castle square raised `ValueError("both split destinations
      must be legal")` from `collapse.resolve_split`, because the UI's
      split-mode highlight dict (`app.py::_legal_by_square`) offered the
      square (a leftover default-argument gap) while the rules layer still
      excluded castling from splits outright. Asked, the user wanted the
      opposite of a re-exclusion: castling should be **reachable by splitting
      the king**, with the rook making one ordinary, non-superposed move
      alongside whichever branch lands on the castle square — see
      `rules.py`/`collapse.py`'s **Split-based castling** writeup above for
      the full mechanism (`split_destination_castle_rook`, the
      classify-before-`has_moved` ordering fix, and the `resolve_move`-mirroring
      "rook follows only if that branch's walk completes" rule). 124 tests
      passing. Later 2026-07-11, promotion for a still-superposed pawn was
      tightened: a quiet push onto the promotion rank used to promote a mere
      *ghost* pawn unconditionally (per the original PLAN.md spec, "a pawn
      ghost reaching the last rank promotes that ghost") — the user asked for
      that ghost to instead be measured on the spot: really there promotes it,
      not there is "its problem" (no promotion; ordinary collapse-mode
      bookkeeping applies to whatever siblings remain). See `collapse.py`'s
      `_resolve_promotion_relocate` writeup above. A fully solid pawn is
      unaffected (nothing left to measure, no dice drawn). 128 tests passing.
      Later 2026-07-11, the pre-game `Menu` was reused mid-game as an
      **in-game Settings screen** (user asked to be able to change colours/
      team name/etc. mid-match, or start over, without quitting to the
      pre-game menu) — see `app.py`'s in-game Settings and `menu.py`'s
      "reused mid-game" writeups above for the full mechanism
      (`App.open_settings`/`_handle_settings_click`, `Menu(in_game=True,
      initial_config=...)`, `Menu.handle_click`'s `(action, config)` return,
      `App.new_game` gaining an optional `config` param). Reachable via a
      "Settings (O)" panel button (added to both `HudSkin`/`ClaritySkin`
      panel layouts, pushing their threat/king-safety modules down to make
      room) or the **O** key; **Escape** backs out without applying anything,
      same contract as everywhere else Escape appears. 135 tests passing.
      Later 2026-07-11, the advisory check metric was **conditioned on the
      king's location** (see `check.py` above) after a playtest where a
      superposed king cornered on every square it could occupy still read `7/9`
      instead of a certain check: a king 2/3 on e7 + 1/3 on g8, both under a
      guaranteed capture, gave the old flat `1 − ∏(1 − p_i)` its
      `1 − (1/3)(2/3) = 7/9` because it treated the king's own presence on
      different squares as *independent* Bernoullis. The king is in exactly one
      place, so danger now partitions by king-ghost square (mutually exclusive,
      weights sum to 1) and averages `q_s · (1 − ∏(1 − a_i))` — the cornered
      king now correctly reads `1`. Solid-king / single-exposed-ghost cases are
      numerically unchanged. 137 tests passing.
      Later 2026-07-11, an optional **mass movement** dial was added (user:
      "move all ghosts in [a piece's] superposition in one move ... [if there
      are] collisions, the game internally rolls where the particle really is
      ... resolve any potential conflicts without the need to collapse all
      ghosts") — see `config.py`/`rules.py`/`collapse.py`/`ui` writeups above
      for the full mechanism (`MassMove`, `resolve_mass_move`'s single
      categorical roll, the planning UI). Locked with the user beforehand: it
      walks each ghost's **full path** (like normal path collapse), it **does
      measure the contacted enemy** on the winning leg (reusing `_walk_contact`),
      it **replaces** the single-ghost move for a superposed piece (holding
      all-but-one ghost = today's move), and — after the user asked — it
      **obeys the Full/Partial collapse-mode dial** in the "dodged onto a safe
      square" branch (Partial keeps the rest superposed; Full collapses to the
      one rolled square). A promoting pawn leg still **prompts for the promotion
      piece** (per-leg picker, `MassMove.promotions`), also at the user's
      request — no auto-queening. 161 tests passing
      (`tests/test_mass_move.py` covers the engine — no-conflict relocation,
      partial/full dodge, conflict capture, CONTACT enemy measurement,
      promotion, king capture, validation; `tests/test_mass_move_ui.py` drives
      the planning + promotion-pick flow headlessly).
      Later 2026-07-11, the advisory check metric was **rewritten to "the enemy's
      strongest single move"** (see `check.py` above) after a playtest where the
      readout kept over-counting — the user: "it should represent the probability
      that the king will be captured if opponent plays his strongest move." The
      previous metric (aggregate danger, conditioned on the king's location,
      `Σ_s q_s · (1 − ∏(1 − a_i))`) still compounded *independent* threats within
      a king square, so two enemy pieces each half-threatening the same king read
      3/4 when the opponent can only play one of them (best = 1/2). The new metric
      takes the **max over every enemy move** of that move's exact capture
      probability, walking each slide's path so a single move that sweeps several
      king ghosts reads as certain while two threats needing two moves take the
      max, not the sum. It also folds in a **mass-move term** when that dial is on
      (a superposed attacker's roll-weighted best legs), and `strongest_threat`
      returns a `KingThreat` whose `describe()` label lets the readout **name the
      strongest move** ("CHECK 2/3 (R a4->e7)"). The old `Threat`/`threats_against`
      internals were replaced by `strongest_threat`/`_path_capture_part`; the
      public `check_probability`/`move_self_check` signatures gained an optional
      `mass_movement` flag (UI passes `config.mass_movement`). 164 tests passing
      (`tests/test_check.py` rewrote the two multi-threat cases and added the
      one-slide-sweep, two-lines-take-max, and mass-move-beats-single tests).
      Later **2026-07-12**, a **graphics overhaul** landed (user: "how to make
      the game more pretty ... can you do better resolution? it is quite
      pixelated") — five improvements, see the `ui/pieces.py`/`theme.SCALE`/
      `ui/present.py` writeup under Architecture above: (1) **supersampling** —
      the whole frame is drawn at 2x and smooth-scaled to a resizable/fullscreen
      window (`ui/present.py`), replacing the nearest-neighbour `SCALED` upscale;
      (2) **selectable piece sets** — real vector art (`cburnett`/`merida` SVGs
      via `load_sized_svg`), a runtime neon silhouette set, and the original
      `unicode`, chosen by a new `config.piece_set` dial + menu picker
      (`ui/pieces.py`); (3) **anti-aliased/higher-res** shapes and text (SSAA +
      scaled strokes); (4) crisper text (scaled fonts); (5) **effects** — soft
      drop shadows on classic pieces, a neon glow on the neon set, and a
      cyberpunk vignette (`gaussian_blur`). Scaling the skins' absolute-pixel
      panels via `theme.px()` was the bulk of the work; the piece-set dial is
      persisted in both game saves and `save_teams`. A follow-up pass the same
      day made piece sets **per-team** (each side picks its own figures — two
      menu rows, `pieces.active(color)`/`set_active(white, black)`,
      `config.white_piece_set`/`black_piece_set`), and fixed two present-layer
      bugs from the first cut: the **hover highlight** now translates the mouse
      through `present.to_logical` (it was hit-testing physical pixels against the
      2x logical board), and **F11 fullscreen** goes through
      `present.toggle_fullscreen` (explicit `set_mode`) instead of the flaky
      `pygame.display.toggle_fullscreen()`. 173 tests passing
      (`tests/test_pieces.py` covers the registry/renderer — set listing,
      unknown-set fallback, SVG rasterization, neon recolour to the side colour,
      shadow/glow padding, and revision-keyed caching; `test_persistence.py`
      gained `piece_set` round-trip + old-file-fallback coverage).
      Later **2026-07-13**, the **mass split** dial landed (user: "if mass move
      is on, I would like a toggle to turn on/off mass split too — when on, I
      can split multiple ghosts, each ghost has an option to move or split") —
      see `config.py`/`rules.py` (`MassSplit`)/`collapse.py`
      (`resolve_mass_split`, sharing a refactored `_resolve_mass_entries` core
      with mass move)/`menu.py` (a third "Mass split" toggle, gated on mass
      moves)/`app.py` (planning `self.plan` values became destination tuples;
      the per-ghost two-pick split gesture via `self.plan_pick_a`, mirroring
      top-level split mode) writeups above for the full mechanism. It's the
      strict generalization of mass movement — a mass-split turn with no actual
      splits resolves byte-for-byte like a mass move — and obeys the same
      single-measurement / collapse-mode semantics. 194 tests passing
      (`tests/test_mass_split.py` covers the engine — single-leg equivalence to
      mass move, a ghost fanning into two halves, merge-by-destination, a split
      branch capturing/dodging under PARTIAL/FULL, promotion, king capture, and
      validation; `tests/test_mass_split_ui.py` drives the two-pick split
      gesture, single-vs-split commit, staying branches, per-branch promotion,
      and Escape back-out headlessly; `test_persistence.py` gained `mass_split`
      round-trip). The floating Confirm/Cancel controls overlap the board's
      bottom-rank squares (a pre-existing mass-move quirk, unchanged).
      Later the same day, two menu-polish requests landed together: (1) a
      **hidden-when-unavailable** dial row (user: "when some option is not
      available, it should be hidden (like mass split without mass move or
      mass move without split)") — the fixed 3-button toggle row became
      `Menu._dial_specs`/`_dial_rects`, computed live so a toggle whose
      prerequisite dial is off is neither drawn nor clickable, with the row
      re-centering itself around however many buttons remain; and (2)
      **automatic settings memory** (user: "make the game remember last
      settings and load them when app starts") — `persistence.save_last_settings`/
      `load_last_settings` round-trip every dial *and* cosmetic field (deliberately
      excluding the seed) to `saves/last_settings.json`, written by the new
      `Menu._finalize` on every Start/New-Game/Resume click and read by the new
      `Menu._load_startup_defaults` when a fresh pre-game menu opens (falling
      back to the older cosmetics-only `_load_teams` for a first run before
      anything's been auto-saved). See `persistence.py`/`menu.py` writeups
      above for the full mechanism. 206 tests passing (`test_persistence.py`
      gained the last-settings round-trip/fallback/version-check tests;
      `test_m4_ui.py` gained dial-visibility, cascading-reset, and
      remember-on-start/resume coverage — two pre-existing settings tests
      needed `monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)` added since Resume/New-Game now
      also touch disk).
      Later the same day, a playtest bug report ("I turn on split, move one
      ghost and the turn ends, I didn't get a chance to split the second
      ghost") turned up a real interaction bug in mass-move/mass-split
      planning: entering planning (`app.py::handle_mouse_down`) required
      `self.mode == "move"`, so a player who toggled to Split mode *first*
      (a natural thing to try when you specifically want to split multiple
      ghosts) had their click fall through to an ordinary one-ghost split
      instead — which, per the "a turn = one action on one ghost" rule, ends
      the turn immediately, before the other ghost(s) can be touched at all.
      Fixed by dropping the mode check entirely: selecting a superposed piece
      always opens planning when the mass-movement dial is on, regardless of
      which mode was active; `_begin_plan` now also resets `self.mode` back to
      `"move"` so the panel's Mode button doesn't keep showing a stale
      "SPLIT" label for the duration of the plan (mode has no meaning once
      inside it). 208 tests passing (`test_mass_move_ui.py`/
      `test_mass_split_ui.py` gained regression coverage entering planning
      from Split mode, including the exact two-ghost split-and-move sequence
      from the bug report).
      Later 2026-07-14, the flip side of that fix was reported ("I'm in move
      mode, but after queen ghost h6->h4 I wanted to move the other queen ghost
      (f6) and it made the first ghost split instead of select the second
      ghost"): inside planning the two-pick split gesture was armed purely by
      the `mass_split` **dial**, ignoring the Move/Split **mode**, so the click
      that aimed a ghost never committed — it sat waiting for a second branch,
      and the next click (on the other ghost, if that square happened to be a
      legal target of the first — which is why it looked side-dependent, it's
      geometry not colour) was swallowed as branch B. Fixed by making the
      toggle govern the gesture inside a plan exactly as it does outside one:
      `App.plan_splitting()` = `can_mass_split() and mode == "split"`, so Move
      mode commits a planned ghost's target on the first click and Split mode
      fans it into two; `toggle_mode` now switches the gesture mid-plan
      (dropping any half-made assignment) instead of cancelling the plan, and
      `_begin_plan` preserves the mode when mass split is on. Planning hints in
      `ui/skins/base.py` follow the mode ("[M] to split a ghost"). 210 tests
      passing (`test_mass_split_ui.py` gained the move-mode-commits-single
      regression + a toggle-mid-plan test; its split-gesture tests now toggle
      into Split mode first).
      Later 2026-07-14, a fifth piece set — **tiger** — was added (user dropped
      `assets/tiger_set.png`, a sheet of tiger-themed chess figures, and asked
      for SVGs of them as a new set). The sheet is a raster, so the SVGs are
      **vector-traced** from it by `tools/trace_tiger.py` (a build-time script,
      committed so the art is regenerable; the game only ever loads the resulting
      SVGs). Since the artwork has just one silhouette per piece (no light/dark
      pair), tiger is a **team-tinted** set like neon, with a contrast rim so a
      pale team colour still reads on a light square — see the `ui/pieces.py`
      writeup above for the full mechanism (`_TINTED`, `theme.ink_for`). It shows
      up in the menu's per-team piece-set rows automatically (both rows are built
      from `pieces.available()`) and persists like any other set choice. 214 tests
      passing (`test_pieces.py` gained tiger rasterization, per-side tint,
      same-shape-both-sides, and contrast-rim coverage).
- [ ] **M5** — (menu dials already landed in M4; this milestone folds into it —
      remaining polish items only, e.g. richer dial explanations in-menu).
- [ ] **M6** — polish pass (see below for what's left).

## Future direction — online play (design only, not built)
Speced in `ONLINE_PLAY.md` (discussed 2026-07-12; nothing implemented). Cheap
here because there's **no hidden info** (both clients see the whole board), **no
timer** (one message/turn), and the **only nondeterminism is the collapse roll**
— resolved by the active side locally and shipped as an *outcome* (action +
`CollapseEvent`s + a `persistence.to_dict` snapshot), so the receiver replays the
same `build_animation` and hard-sets state; RNG never needs syncing (only the
active side ever draws). Plan: a transport-agnostic `NetSession` seam +
`to_dict`/`from_dict` for `Move`/`Split`/`MassMove`/`CollapseEvent`, turn-gated
on `qb.turn`, then a direct TCP socket (Tailscale for internet); a hosted
WebSocket relay drops in behind the same interface later. Engine stays
networking-free (same rule as pygame).

## Known deferred edge cases
- En passant against a **superposed** victim pawn is not offered as a move (only
  offered while the would-be-captured pawn is solid). Flagged in `rules.py`
  (`_pawn_dest`). Rare combination; revisit if it matters in play.
- A pawn that reaches the back rank via a **CONTACT** move (i.e. through a
  collapse, not a plain push) does not promote — promotion is only wired for the
  deterministic RELOCATE/CAPTURE_SOLID cases (see `rules.py::_pawn_dest`'s
  `emit`). Rare; revisit if it comes up in play.
- UI: seed is chosen by a "reroll" button (random each click), not free-text
  entry — good enough for reproducing a match by writing the number down, not
  for typing an exact known seed. Aura colours cycle through an 8-colour
  palette by `piece_id % 8`, so with many simultaneously-superposed pieces two
  could coincidentally share a colour (cosmetic only, not a correctness issue).

## Conventions
- Reuse python-chess constants everywhere (colours `chess.WHITE/BLACK`, piece types,
  square ints 0..63) for zero-friction interop.
- Keep probabilities as `Fraction` (exact; tests assert per-piece sums == 1).
- When you build the quantum layer, replace `to_classical_board()` callers with
  ghost-aware occupancy rather than extending that solid-only helper.
